# Individual Project for GA Data Science Course
## Project Outline
### NYC Yellow Taxi 2013
* This project explores multiple aspects of the publicly available NYC Taxi data set.
* This project ultimately tries to cluster parts of taxi trips together so users can efficiently ride-share.
* Visualisations will be important both as an intermediate step towards machine learning and as final products of gaining insights.
* The data set contains variables such as pick-up and drop-off points, time of the day, number of passengers, travel time and fare.
