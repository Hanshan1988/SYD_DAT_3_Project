# Individual Project for GA Data Science Course
## Project Outline
### Project 1: NYC Yellow Taxi 
* This project explores multiple aspects of the publicly available NYC Taxi data set.
* This project ultimately tries to cluster parts of taxi trips together so users can efficiently ride-share.
* Visualisations will be important both as an intermediate step towards machine learning and as final products of gaining insights.
* The data set contains variables such as pick-up and drop-off points, time of the day, and fare.

### Project 2: Taxi Trajectory and Time Prediction (Kaggle)
* This project tries to predict the final destination and time of taxi trips from initial part of trips.
* This project only has the time-interval of lattitdue and longitude of taxi trips.
* Visualisation will be important to get a sense of the trips 

### Project 3: Human Activity Recognition (UCI ML Repository) 
* This project aims to classify user behaviours from sensor data from mobile phones such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings.
* This is ultimately a classification problem with important feature engineering/selection components.
